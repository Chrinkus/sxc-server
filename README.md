# sxc-servers

In this project I'll be implementing some simple servers to practice my network programming in C. My initial thoughts are to progress as such:

0. Simple client-server (based on [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/))
1. Mock-back server
1. Command-line chat app
1. Chat app with GUI (web-based or otherwise)
1. An HTTP server
1. A game server (will probably require a game..)

I'm sure I'll come across some other engineering challenges along the way and I'll do my best to document them.
